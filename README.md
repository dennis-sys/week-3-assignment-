calculate_discount()
#How this works:

1. **Function `calculate_discount()`**: 
   - Takes two parameters: `price` and `discount_percent`
   - Uses an `if-else` statement to check if the discount is 20% or higher
   - If yes, calculates the discounted price using the formula: `price * (1 - discount_percent/100)`
   - If no, returns the original price

2. **User Input**:
   - Prompts the user to enter the original price and discount percentage
   - Converts inputs to float for numerical calculations

3. **Output**:
   - Prints the final price with proper formatting
   - Shows whether a discount was applied or not
